# Dareu Kaengi OS Developer Documentation

## Project Overview
Dareu Kaengi OS is an operating system designed with a microkernel architecture, advanced AI capabilities, and a modular design that supports easy updates and minimal reboot requirements.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the kernel, drivers, and modules.
- **build/**: Output directory for compiled binaries.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation for developers and users.
- **tests/**: Contains benchmarking and stress testing scripts.

## Kernel Components
### Kernel Initialization
The kernel is initialized in `src/kernel/kernel.c`. Essential services such as IPC, network support, memory management, interrupt handling, AI capabilities, and module management are initialized here.

### Memory Management
Memory management is handled in `src/kernel/memory.c`. Efficient memory management mechanisms are implemented, including memory map setup and paging.

### Task Scheduling
Task scheduling is managed in `src/kernel/scheduler.c`. Efficient task scheduling mechanisms are implemented to ensure minimal overhead and optimal CPU utilization.

### Interrupt Handling
Interrupt handling is implemented in `src/kernel/interrupts.c`. Efficient interrupt handling mechanisms are set up, including IDT initialization and interrupt enabling.

### AI Capabilities
AI capabilities are integrated into the kernel in `src/kernel/ai.c`. The AI framework, 3D interactive model, and user interaction modules are set up here.

### Module Management
Module management is handled in `src/kernel/module.c`. The kernel is designed to be modular, supporting easy updates and minimal reboot requirements.

## Benchmarks and Stress Testing
Benchmarks and stress tests are implemented in `tests/benchmark.c` to validate the OS performance.

## Build Instructions
To build the kernel, run:
```
make
```

To clean the build files, run:
```
make clean
```
