# Dareu Kaengi OS
This is a project to create an entirely from-scratch operating system with a microkernel architecture, advanced AI capabilities, and a modular design that supports easy updates and minimal reboot requirements.

## Current Status
The project has been significantly developed. The following components have been implemented:
- Basic kernel initialization and process management
- Memory management and task scheduling
- Efficient interrupt handling mechanisms
- Efficient memory management
- Efficient task scheduling
- AI capabilities
- Modular design with easy updates and minimal reboot requirements
- Benchmarks and stress testing for performance validation

### Next Steps
1. **Documentation and Support**: Provide comprehensive documentation for developers and create user-friendly documentation for end-users.
2. **Community Engagement**: Encourage open-source contributions from the community and establish a feedback loop for user input.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the kernel, drivers, and modules.
- **build/**: Output directory for compiled binaries.

## Build Instructions
To build the kernel, run:
```
make
```

To clean the build files, run:
```
make clean
